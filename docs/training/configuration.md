# Training Configuration

## Model Training Pipeline

The training pipeline is fully automated and triggered by:
- Push to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Scheduled training jobs

### Configuration Options

```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 2e-5
  epochs: 10
  max_length: 512
  warmup_steps: 500
  weight_decay: 0.01
  
evaluation:
  benchmark: GAIA
  levels: [1, 2, 3]
  metrics:
    - accuracy
    - f1_score
    - completion_rate

checkpoints:
  save_strategy: steps
  save_steps: 500
  save_total_limit: 3
```

## Automated Release Process

1. Training completion triggers evaluation
2. Results compared against previous SOTA
3. If improvements detected:
   - New model version tagged
   - Documentation updated
   - Release created
   - Model pushed to Hugging Face Hub

## TODO
- [ ] Add dynamic learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Implement multi-GPU training support
- [ ] Add cross-validation pipeline
- [ ] Enhance checkpoint management
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework
