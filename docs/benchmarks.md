# Benchmarks

## GAIA Benchmark Overview

GAIA (General AI Assistant) is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants' capabilities in solving real-world problems. The benchmark consists of three distinct difficulty levels, each testing different aspects of AI capabilities.

### Benchmark Levels

#### Level 1: Basic Tasks
- Language understanding and generation
- Simple task completion
- Basic reasoning capabilities
- Direct question answering

#### Level 2: Complex Problems
- Multi-step problem solving
- Context awareness
- Logical reasoning
- Task planning and execution

#### Level 3: Advanced Challenges
- Abstract reasoning
- Creative problem solving
- Decision making under uncertainty
- Complex system understanding

## GenZ Performance

GenZ has achieved state-of-the-art performance across all three difficulty levels of the GAIA benchmark. This achievement demonstrates GenZ's capabilities as a truly general AI assistant, particularly noteworthy for its proficiency in Bangla language tasks.

### Automated Evaluation

Our continuous integration pipeline includes automated benchmark evaluation:
1. Regular testing on GAIA benchmark suite
2. Performance tracking and logging
3. Automated result compilation
4. Continuous comparison with previous versions

## TODO
- [ ] Add specific performance metrics for each level
- [ ] Include comparison charts with other models
- [ ] Add real-world use case examples
- [ ] Implement automated performance regression testing
