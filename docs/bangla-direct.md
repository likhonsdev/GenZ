# Bangla Direct

The GenZ project is committed to advancing the field of Natural Language Processing for the Bangla language. Our goal is to create a state-of-the-art AGI model that can understand and generate Bangla text with high accuracy.

## Our Commitment

- **Bangla First**: We are dedicated to prioritizing the Bangla language in all our research and development efforts.
- **Open Source**: We believe in the power of open-source technology to drive innovation and are committed to making our work accessible to everyone.
- **Community Driven**: We aim to foster a vibrant community around Bangla AI development and welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and language enthusiasts.

## Why Bangla?

Bangla is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet it is underrepresented in the field of AI. We believe that by creating a powerful Bangla AGI model, we can help bridge this gap and empower millions of Bangla speakers with the latest AI technology.
